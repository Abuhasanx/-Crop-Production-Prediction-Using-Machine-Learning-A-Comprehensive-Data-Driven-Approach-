# Crop-Production Prediction Using Machine Learning A Comprehensive Data Driven Approach
This project predicts crop production using machine learning. It includes data cleaning, EDA, and a Power BI dashboard for analysis. The Random Forest model, trained and evaluated on the dataset, achieved the best performance. The model is deployed via a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
